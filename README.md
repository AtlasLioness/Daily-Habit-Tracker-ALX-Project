# Dailio - Your Daily Habit Tracker

**Dailio** is an intuitive and simple-to-use habit tracker that helps you track, manage, and achieve your daily goals. Whether you want to form new habits or break old ones, Dailio provides a seamless and motivating experience to stay on top of your daily tasks.

## The Story Behind the Project  

Growing up, I always had a hard time sticking to a healthy daily routine. Whether it was remembering to eat breakfast, meditate, or just take a break from work, I often lost track and ended up quitting halfway. I knew I needed something to help me stay on top of these habits, so I decided to build an app that could do just that. I wanted something simple that would keep me accountable and remind me to stick with it each day, even if the tasks felt small.

That’s how the Daily Habit Tracker app came to be. It’s all about making habit-building easier and more fun. I genuinely believe that good habits are key to achieving any goal, and this app is my way of helping myself—and anyone else—stay on track.
